# Host API Reference

The contract Mydia plugins run against: the event envelope and catalog, the
capability classes and their host functions, the scheduled-handler export, and
the manifest fields that govern versioning.

New to plugins? Start with the
[tutorial](../tutorial/write-your-first-plugin.md). For task-oriented recipes,
see the [how-to guides](../how-to/notifications.md). For why the platform is
shaped this way (the sandbox, the capability model, the host-version floor),
see [The plugin model](../explanation/plugin-model.md).

## The event

The host delivers a typed `Event` record:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `event` | `String` | The event type, e.g. `media_item.added`. |
| `category`, `severity` | `Option<String>` | Envelope classification. |
| `actor_type`, `actor_id` | `Option<String>` | Who triggered it. |
| `resource_type`, `resource_id` | `Option<String>` | What it concerns. |
| `metadata_json` | `String` | A JSON object string of per-event metadata (and any operator config). `"{}"` when empty. |

The arbitrary per-event detail (and the operator's plugin settings) ride in
`metadata_json` as a JSON object, so the typed envelope stays stable while the
payload varies by event. Parse it with any JSON crate when you need it.

### Event catalog

A plugin subscribes to events in its manifest; each must be in the catalog:

- `media_item.added`, `media_item.updated`, `media_item.removed`
- `media_file.imported`
- `download.completed`, `download.failed`

Events carry an `origin` (`sync:<provider>` or `plugin:<slug>`) in
`metadata_json` when one applies. The dispatcher never delivers an event back to
the plugin that originated it, so write-backs don't echo.

## Capabilities

Capabilities are **deny-by-default** and enforced server-side on every call. A
plugin can never widen its own grant. A manifest *declares* what it wants; the
operator approves it.

| Class | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `events:subscribe` | The event types the plugin reacts to (from the catalog above). Required. |
| `net:http` | The exact hostnames the plugin may contact. **No wildcards** (a wildcard subdomain is an exfiltration channel). |
| `data:read` | Scoped read namespaces (`media_item`). The host returns a curated, read-only projection: never raw rows or secrets. |
| `state:kv` | A per-plugin key/value store (`@max_keys` 256 keys, 64 KB per value) for watermarks, cursors, and dedupe sets. |
| `users:connections` | Per-user third-party connections: the host holds the token; the plugin gets identity + status only. **Cross-user, consent-scoped.** |
| `schedule:interval` | Run `on-schedule` on a fixed interval (manifest `schedule`, 5-minute floor). |

### Host functions

Reach capabilities through the typed SDK bindings under
`mydia_plugin_sdk::host`:

```rust
use mydia_plugin_sdk::host;
use mydia_plugin_sdk::types::{DataRequest, OutboundRequest, ReadResult};

// data:read (a curated media-item projection).
if let Ok(ReadResult::MediaItem(item)) =
    host::data_read(&DataRequest { namespace: "media_item".into(), id })
{
    let _ = item.title;
}

// net:http (a gated outbound request). The host re-validates the URL host
// against your net:http allowlist and runs an SSRF gate on every call.
let resp = host::http_request(&OutboundRequest {
    url: "https://example.com/hook".into(),
    method: "POST".into(),
    headers: vec![("content-type".into(), "application/json".into())],
    body: Some("{}".into()),
});

// log (ungated diagnostics into the plugin's activity log).
host::log("info", "did the thing");
```

Each `result<_, host-error>` surfaces a denial (`Denied`), a bad request, a
not-found, or a network error: handle it; the host never lets a guest bypass
the gate.

### 1.1 host functions

```rust
use mydia_plugin_sdk::host;
use mydia_plugin_sdk::types::{ListRequest, ListItem};

// state:kv (opaque per-plugin storage across invocations).
host::kv_set("watermark", "2024-06-01T00:00:00Z").ok();
let mark = host::kv_get("watermark").ok().flatten();   // Option<String>
host::kv_delete("watermark").ok();

// data:read via data-list (cursor-paginated, updated-since filtered). Walk
// next_cursor until None.
let page = host::data_list(&ListRequest {
    namespace: "media_item".into(),
    cursor: None,
    updated_since: mark.clone(),
    limit: Some(200),
}).unwrap();
for item in page.items {
    if let ListItem::MediaItem(m) = item { let _ = m.title; }
}

// users:connections: identity + status only (never a token).
for c in host::connections_list().unwrap() { let _ = (c.id, c.user_id, c.status); }

// connection-request (an authenticated request). The host verifies the
// connection belongs to you, strips any guest Authorization, and injects the
// bearer token itself. You never see the token.
// host::connection_request(&c.id, &outbound_request)
```

Key guarantees:

- `data-list` cursors are opaque and request-local: walk them within one run,
  never persist them.
- `kv-set` is an engine-native upsert (last write wins); keys are opaque to the
  host. Keys under `conn/<connection-id>/...` are swept when that connection is
  removed.

### Scheduled handler

Add `on-schedule` for periodic work (declare a `schedule` and the
`schedule:interval` capability in the manifest):

```rust
use mydia_plugin_sdk::types::{Event, ScheduleTick};

#[mydia_plugin_sdk::plugin(on_schedule = on_schedule)]
fn on_event(evt: Event) -> Result<String, String> { Ok("{}".into()) }

fn on_schedule(tick: ScheduleTick) -> Result<String, String> {
    // tick.config_json carries the operator settings. Return a small JSON result;
    // include "connections_invalid": ["<user-id>"] to flag users whose token
    // the provider rejected (a 401). The host marks those connections errored.
    Ok("{\"connections_invalid\":[]}".into())
}
```

A run that takes longer than one interval is fine: the next tick is skipped
while it runs (non-reentrant), and your state must survive a wall-clock kill, so
checkpoint progress to KV as you go.

## Manifest

A plugin ships a JSON manifest declaring its identity, the events it
subscribes to, the capabilities it wants, and any operator-editable settings.
See [Manifest & Settings](manifest.md) for the full field reference and a
complete worked example.

### Host-version floor

`min_host_version` (optional, a semantic version) declares the lowest Mydia host
your plugin supports. Mydia refuses to activate a plugin whose floor exceeds the
running host with a clear `requires mydia >= X` message (the friendly wrapper
over wasmtime's hard link-time refusal). Omit it if you have no floor.

### Evolving the contract

The WIT package version **is** the ABI version. The contract evolves
**additively**: new host functions, new records, new variant cases, and new
exports are added without touching existing types or signatures. A plugin built
against an older minor keeps working: the host detects each guest's contract
version from its bytes and serves the matching interface namespace and exports,
so a `1.0` guest's `on-event` still resolves against a `1.1` host. Only a removal
or a signature change bumps the major version. Target the lowest host you need
via `min_host_version`; a `1.1` guest sets `"min_host_version": "1.1.0"` so an
older host refuses it cleanly rather than failing to link.
