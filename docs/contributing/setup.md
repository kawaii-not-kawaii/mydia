# Development Setup

Set up a local development environment for Mydia.

The local developer environment is built on [devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh) (a
Nix-based, declarative dev environment) and auto-loaded per git worktree via
[direnv](https://direnv.net). The daily loop (Phoenix server, `mix test`,
`mix precommit`) runs **natively** (no Docker dev container).
Each worktree derives its own non-colliding ports and isolated state, so several
worktrees can run their full stacks at once.

> Docker is still used for the production image (`Dockerfile`) and the
> metadata-relay deploy, but **not** for day-to-day development.

## Prerequisites

- **Nix**: https://nixos.org/download (the Determinate Systems installer works well)
- **devenv**: `nix profile install nixpkgs#devenv`
- **direnv**: https://direnv.net (install + hook into your shell)
- **Git**

Your user must be a Nix **trusted user** (devenv requires it). If `devenv shell`
fails with `ignoring the client-specified setting 'system' … you are not a
trusted user`, add yourself:

```bash
echo "extra-trusted-users = $USER" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.custom.conf
sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon   # or: sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/org.nixos.nix-daemon (macOS)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getmydia/mydia.git
cd mydia

# Authorize direnv for this worktree (one time). This builds the toolchain and
# runs first-run setup (deps.get, asset npm install). The first
# build downloads the toolchain and can take a while.
#
# Shell entry deliberately does NOT touch the development database: it must not
# boot the app or start a service. `./dev up` sets the database up before
# starting Phoenix, and `./dev db.setup` does it on demand.
direnv allow

# Start the stack (Phoenix)
./dev up
```

On shell entry devenv prints this worktree's assigned URL and ports, e.g.:

```
Mydia dev environment (devenv): /home/you/mydia
  Phoenix:   http://localhost:4740
```

Open the printed Phoenix URL (the port is derived from the worktree path, so it
is stable across restarts but differs between worktrees).

If you don't use direnv, run commands through `devenv shell` directly, or just
use the `./dev` wrapper (it loads the environment for each command).

## Per-worktree ports & overrides

Ports are derived deterministically by hashing the worktree's absolute path, so
two worktrees never collide and you can run both stacks simultaneously. Ports
change only if the checkout physically moves (a branch rename does not change
them).

To pin ports explicitly (escape hatch for a hash collision or a fixed port),
copy the example override (git-ignored) and edit it:

```bash
cp devenv.local.nix.example devenv.local.nix
```

## PostgreSQL (optional)

SQLite is the default adapter and needs no service. To develop against
PostgreSQL, set `DATABASE_TYPE=postgres` before entering the shell; devenv then
runs a per-worktree Postgres (data under `.devenv/state/postgres`) on a derived
port and creates `mydia_dev` / `mydia_test`.

> `initialDatabases` only runs on first init. To change it later, delete
> `.devenv/state/postgres` and re-enter the shell.

`DATABASE_TYPE` is read when devenv evaluates, so export it *before* entering
the shell. Postgres builds into `_build/postgres` rather than `_build`, because
the Ecto adapter is a compile-time setting and sharing one build root between
adapters makes Phoenix restart-loop on a compile-env mismatch. Switching back
and forth costs no recompile.

## The `./dev` Script

`./dev` is a thin wrapper over devenv that preserves the historical command
vocabulary. Run `./dev` with no arguments to see everything.

### Process lifecycle

```bash
./dev up -d        # Start the stack in the background
./dev down         # Stop background processes
./dev restart      # Restart the stack
./dev logs phoenix # Show a process's logs
./dev ps           # List managed processes
```

### Shells & mix

```bash
./dev shell        # Interactive devenv shell
./dev iex          # IEx console (iex -S mix)
./dev mix <args>   # Any mix command
./dev mix test     # Run tests
./dev mix format   # Format code
```

### Shortcuts

```bash
./dev test         # Run tests
./dev format       # Format code
./dev deps.get     # Fetch dependencies
./dev db.setup     # Create and migrate the development database
./dev ecto.migrate # Run migrations
```

`./dev up`, `./dev iex`, and `./dev phx.server` run `db.setup` for you. `./dev
test` and `./dev mix` do not need it: the `test` alias builds and migrates its
own database, and formatting, Credo, and compilation never open one.

## Code Quality

### Pre-commit checks

```bash
./dev mix precommit
```

Runs Dependencies → Compile (warnings-as-errors) → Unused deps → Format →
Database → Tests, with a compact per-step summary.

> Precommit runs against the active adapter. SQLite (the default) serializes
> async tests; `DATABASE_TYPE=postgres ./dev mix precommit` uses the warm
> Postgres and keeps async tests parallel.

### Git hooks

Pre-commit hooks are managed by devenv (`git-hooks.hooks` in `devenv.nix`) and
installed automatically when you enter the shell. They lint Rust (cargo
fmt/clippy against the pinned 1.96.0 toolchain), the WASM plugin guests, and
Elixir formatting. No `nix develop` needed. devenv owns the generated
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` (git-ignored); edit `devenv.nix` to change hooks.
