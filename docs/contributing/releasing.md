# Releasing

Mydia and the metadata-relay service release through two different mechanisms.
This page covers both.

## Mydia

Releases are draft-first. The draft is created by hand, the workflow builds
against it, and the workflow publishes it at the end. GitHub creates the git tag
at publish time, so no tag exists while the release is being built.

This shape is forced by two constraints. The repository has Immutable Releases
enabled, so assets can only be uploaded while a release is still a draft. And
GitHub Actions silently drops the `release: created` event for drafts, so the
workflow cannot trigger on the release itself and is dispatched manually
instead.

### Cutting a release

**1. Write the release notes into the repository.**

Open a PR adding `priv/changelog/0.13.0.md`, containing only what changed in
this release. Do not carry forward the previous version's content; the app
stacks releases itself for anyone who skipped one.

This must be the last thing merged before you pin a commit, because the draft
targets a SHA and the image is built from it. The workflow refuses to build a
stable release whose notes file is missing at the pinned commit, failing in
`prepare` before any platform build starts.

Prereleases are exempt. They keep hand-written notes and ship no bundled file.

**2. Pin a commit and create the draft.**

```bash
git fetch origin
SHA=$(git rev-parse origin/master)

gh release create v0.13.0 \
  --repo getmydia/mydia \
  --target "$SHA" \
  --draft \
  --notes-file priv/changelog/0.13.0.md
```

Add `--prerelease` for a beta or rc.

`--target` must be a full commit SHA. A branch name is resolved once when the
workflow builds and again when GitHub creates the tag, which lets the tag land
on code that was never built. The workflow rejects a draft that targets a
branch.

Pinning also fixes what the release contains. Anything merged to master after
this point is simply not in the release, which is what you want, and the
workflow tells you about it rather than absorbing it silently.

**3. Dispatch the workflow.**

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo getmydia/mydia -f version=v0.13.0
```

The workflow builds Docker images for both database variants on both
architectures and publishes the draft.

For a stable release it then deploys versioned documentation. Prereleases skip
the docs deploy.

### Dispatch inputs

| Input | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | required | Tag of an existing draft release. Ignored when `dry_run` is set. |
| `dry_run` | `false` | Build everything without publishing or pushing images. |
| `accept_drift` | `false` | Proceed even though master has moved past the commit the draft targets. |
| `allow_missing` | `""` | Comma-separated platforms whose failure must not block publish: `docker`. |

### Patch releases

A patch release's GitHub notes carry the preceding minor's notes as well, so
someone reading the release page sees the whole story. The bundled file still
holds only the patch's own changes, so the app never shows the same content
twice. Concatenate at release time:

```bash
cat priv/changelog/0.13.1.md priv/changelog/0.13.0.md > /tmp/notes.md

gh release create v0.13.1 \
  --repo getmydia/mydia \
  --target "$SHA" \
  --draft \
  --notes-file /tmp/notes.md
```

### Rehearsing

A rehearsal runs the release path against master without side effects:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo getmydia/mydia -f dry_run=true
```

A rehearsal builds every image without pushing to ghcr, and skips the publish
step and the docs deploy. It needs no draft.

Run one before any release you care about, and after any change to
`release.yml` or the Dockerfile.

### When the workflow refuses

**"Draft targets 'master', which is a branch, not a commit."**

The draft was created without `--target <sha>`. Pin it:

```bash
gh release edit v0.13.0 --repo getmydia/mydia --target "$(git rev-parse origin/master)"
```

**"N commit(s) landed on master after this draft was cut."**

Someone merged while the release was being prepared, so the notes no longer
describe what would ship. The run summary lists the commits. Either fold them in:

```bash
gh release edit v0.13.0 --repo getmydia/mydia --target "$(git rev-parse origin/master)"
# then update the notes to cover the new commits
```

Or ship the pinned commit as-is and leave the rest for the next release:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo getmydia/mydia -f version=v0.13.0 -f accept_drift=true
```

**"v0.13.0 has no bundled release notes at priv/changelog/0.13.0.md in commit ab12cd34ef56."**

The notes PR from step 1 never got merged, or was merged after this draft was
already pinned. Write `priv/changelog/0.13.0.md`, merge it, then re-pin the
draft to the new commit and dispatch again:

```bash
gh release edit v0.13.0 --repo getmydia/mydia --target "$(git rev-parse origin/master)"
gh workflow run release.yml --repo getmydia/mydia -f version=v0.13.0
```

**"Refusing to publish: docker (failure) did not succeed."**

The image build failed. The release stays a draft and nothing was published.
Re-run the failed jobs from the Actions UI, which reuses the same run.

If the failure is external and you need to ship anyway, name it explicitly:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo getmydia/mydia -f version=v0.13.0 -f allow_missing=docker
```

The published release then carries a note saying which assets are absent.

### Recovering from a failed release

Nothing is published until every gate passes, so a failed run leaves the draft
intact. Fix the cause and dispatch again with the same version.

One thing does survive a failed run: per-arch Docker images tagged
`<version>-amd64` and `<version>-arm64` may already be in ghcr, and they are
overwritten by the next attempt.

## Docker tags

Every tag has a `-pg` counterpart built against PostgreSQL. The unsuffixed tag
is the SQLite build.

| Tag | Points at |
| --- | --- |
| `master`, `master-pg` | Every commit on master. Built by `ci-docker.yml`, not the release workflow. |
| `latest`, `latest-pg` | The newest published stable release. |
| `beta`, `beta-pg` | The newest published prerelease. |
| `0.13.0`, `0.13.0-pg` | That exact release. Never moves. |
| `0.13`, `0.13-pg` | The newest stable release on that minor line. |
| `0`, `0-pg` | The newest stable release on that major line. |

The floating tags only ever move forward. Publishing a v0.11.2 patch after
v0.12.0 applies `0.11.2` and `0.11`, and leaves `latest` and `0` pointing at
v0.12.0.

## Release notes

Notes are authored into `priv/changelog/<version>.md` and tracked in the
repository. The app compiles that file into the image, and the draft's
GitHub notes are produced from it too. Nothing is generated from the commit
range.

A patch release's GitHub notes carry the preceding minor's notes as well as
its own, produced by concatenating the two bundled files. The bundled file
itself holds only the patch's own changes, since the app stacks releases
itself for anyone who skipped one.

## Metadata relay

The relay releases on a pushed tag rather than a dispatched draft.
`deploy-relay.yml` triggers on tags matching `metadata-relay-v*`:

```bash
git tag -a metadata-relay-v0.12.0 -m "Metadata Relay v0.12.0"
git push origin metadata-relay-v0.12.0
```

The relay lives in this repository at `metadata-relay/` but deploys entirely
separately, so its version is independent of mydia's.
