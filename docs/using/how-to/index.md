# How-to Guides

How-to guides are recipes for accomplishing a specific task, assuming you
already have Mydia running. Jump to the one you need; you do not have to read
them in order.

If you are starting from nothing, begin with a
[tutorial](../tutorials/index.md) instead.

- [Installation](install-docker-compose.md) - install Mydia with Docker Compose or the Docker CLI
- [Download clients](connect-download-client.md) - connect a torrent, usenet, or debrid client
- [Indexers](connect-indexer.md) - connect Prowlarr, Jackett, or a Cardigann indexer
- [Cardigann indexers](cardigann-indexers.md) - configure Mydia's built-in Cardigann support
- [Managing libraries](manage-libraries.md) - create, scan, and maintain library paths
- [Adding media](add-media.md) - search for and add media you do not already have
- [Importing an existing collection](import-existing-collection.md) - bring files already on disk into a library
- [Quality profiles](quality-profiles.md) - create and assign quality profiles
- [Automatic quality upgrades](automatic-quality-upgrades.md) - replace files that fall below your cutoff with better releases
- [User management](manage-users.md) - roles, accounts, and the request system
- [SSO/OIDC configuration](sso-oidc.md) - configure single sign-on
- [PostgreSQL support](postgresql.md) - run Mydia on PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- [Reverse proxy](reverse-proxy.md) - put Mydia behind Nginx, Traefik, or Caddy
- [Backup and restore](backup-restore.md) - back up and restore the database and configuration
- [Updating Mydia](update-mydia.md) - update your installation or track a pre-release build
- [Monitoring and logs](monitor-and-logs.md) - check health and view logs
- [NixOS deployment](nixos.md) - deploy Mydia declaratively on NixOS
