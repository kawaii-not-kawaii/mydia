  @moduledoc """
  Shared invocation of the `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` binaries.

  Before this module existed, `run_ffmpeg/1` was copy-pasted as a private
  function into `PhashGenerator` and `ThumbnailGenerator`. Both now delegate
  here.

  Both binaries can be overridden for tests via application env
  (`:ffmpeg_path`, `:ffprobe_path`), which must be absolute paths; otherwise
  they are resolved from PATH.

  @doc """
  Runs `ffmpeg` with `args` and returns the combined stdout/stderr output.

  By default stderr is merged into the returned output (matching the
  original behavior of three of the four generators, which write their
  result to a file and only use the returned text for error diagnostics).

  Pass `stderr_to_stdout: false` when the command writes its actual result
  to stdout (for example piping raw frame data via `-f rawvideo ... -`), so
  ffmpeg's banner and log lines on stderr don't corrupt the payload. This
  matches `PhashGenerator`'s original behavior for its pixel-extraction call.

  The output is typed `binary()` rather than `String.t()` because it is not
  always text: `PhashGenerator` reads raw grayscale pixel bytes back through
  this function.
